# Final project for ITF Manual Testing Course

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application.

Application under test: [Orange_HRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login).

Original documentation: [Orange_HRM](https://www.orangehrm.com/assets/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf?url=/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf).

Tools used: JIRA and Zephyr Squad.

# Functional specifications

The application chosen by me for testing is https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/admin/viewSystemUsers, the "Admin" module: "User Management" and "Job" sections.

The test project was created using the Jira tool. It contains two epics, one for the "User Management" section, with the requirement to verify the functionality to administer users as an Admin, and the second one for the "Job" section, in which all the information related to the "Job" field can be accessed and assigned to users.
